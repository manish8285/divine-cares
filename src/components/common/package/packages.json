Our doctors will guide you honestly about realistic expectations and the need for any investigations.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    <strong>Ready to begin?</strong> Choose the package that suits you, upload any reports if available, and our doctor will contact you to start a\n    personalized, safe, and monitored treatment plan.\n  </p>\n</section>",
